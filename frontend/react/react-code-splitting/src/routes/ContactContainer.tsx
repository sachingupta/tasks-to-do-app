export { Contact as default } from "./Contact";

/* React.lazy currently only supports default exports. 
If the module you want to import uses named exports, 
you can create an intermediate module that reexports 
it as the default. This ensures that tree shaking keeps working and 
that you donâ€™t pull in unused components.
